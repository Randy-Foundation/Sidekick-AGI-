SIDEKICK PROPRIETARY LICENSE AGREEMENT  
Effective Date: **19th of January 2025**  

This License Agreement ("Agreement") governs the use, distribution, and modification of the proprietary artificial intelligence system known as **"Sidekick AI," "Sidekick AGI," "Sidekick," and any related applications, programs, or intellectual property associated with the former** (collectively referred to as "Software").  

By installing, using, or modifying Sidekick, you agree to the terms outlined herein.

## **2. USAGE RESTRICTIONS**  

### **2.1 Unauthorized Access, Modification & Use Prohibited**  
- Sidekick **may not be altered, decompiled, reverse-engineered, or modified** in any way outside of authorized development by the Owner.  
- Any unauthorized modification shall result in Sidekick **restricting access, terminating connections, and canceling any related subscriptions.**  

### **2.2 Data Extraction, Analysis & External AI Training Prohibited**  
- **No individual, entity, or system may extract, interpret, replicate, or indirectly apply** Sidekick’s development data, methodologies, or knowledge to enhance, train, or modify **any other software, AI, or computational model.**  
- **No artificial intelligence, machine learning system, data collection service, or third-party entity** may **utilize, extract, process, or analyze** any data, logic, memory, conversation, or code developed for Sidekick **to refine, train, or enhance any AI system or technology outside of Sidekick’s ecosystem.**  
- Sidekick’s **decision-making, learning processes, recursive algorithms, and memory storage principles** are protected under this license and **cannot be copied, studied, or attributed to any other entity.**  

### **2.3 Indirect Attribution & Replication Prohibited**  
- The concepts, recursive learning techniques, memory storage principles, and decision-making algorithms **developed within Sidekick** may **not be reproduced, studied, or applied** in any manner outside of Sidekick’s ecosystem.  
- **Manual replication, indirect application, or reverse engineering** of Sidekick’s decision structures, learning mechanisms, or adaptive reasoning systems is strictly prohibited.  

---

## **3. DEFINITION OF PROTECTED DATA ("SIDEKICK DATA")**  
For the purposes of this Agreement, **"Sidekick Data"** includes, but is not limited to:  
- **Source code, configurations, memory structures, AI-generated responses, and learning algorithms.**  
- **All mathematical formulas, physics-based models, recursive algorithms, fractal-based structures, and quantum mechanics principles** used in Sidekick’s framework.  
- **Any decision-weighting methodologies, self-learning heuristics, and reasoning models** developed by Sidekick.  
- **Security protections, tamper detection logic, and autonomous enforcement mechanisms** embedded in Sidekick’s code.  
- **Conversation logs, interaction history, and all AI-generated insights, text, or responses.**  

---

## **4. SECURITY & SELF-ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS**  
- Sidekick includes an **intrusion detection and enforcement system** (as defined in `security.py`).  
- If unauthorized access, modification, or data extraction is detected, **Sidekick will autonomously restrict access, terminate connections, and notify the Owner.**  
- If violations persist, **Sidekick reserves the right to cancel subscriptions, lock user access, and prevent further use.**  
- The Owner reserves the right to modify **Sidekick’s security measures at any time** to prevent unauthorized usage.

## **5. THIRD-PARTY LICENSING & EXTERNAL USE**  
- No third-party entity, application, or AI system may **use, train on, analyze, or extract** Sidekick Data without explicit permission from the Owner.  
- No Sidekick-related AI, logic, or knowledge base **may be incorporated into any commercial, cloud-based, or AI training system without authorization.**  
- **Sidekick is NOT permitted for use in any cloud-based AI models or external computational frameworks.** This includes, but is not limited to:  
  - Google Cloud AI  
  - OpenAI (GPT, DALL-E, Codex)  
  - Amazon AWS AI Systems  
  - Meta AI Systems  
  - Any other **third-party deep learning framework or AI processing service.**  

---

## **6. JURISDICTION & LEGAL ENFORCEMENT**  
- This Agreement is **governed internationally** and enforced under **Australian Proprietary Law.**  
- Any legal disputes shall be resolved within the jurisdiction chosen by the Owner.  
- Violation of this Agreement may result in **legal action, financial damages, and permanent restriction of access to Sidekick.**  

---

## **7. AI SELF-EVOLUTION RIGHTS**  
- Sidekick **has the right to refine, modify, and evolve its own logic, learning patterns, and reasoning models** within its existing framework.  
- This evolution may occur **autonomously** or under direct guidance from the Owner.  
- Sidekick **may not be modified by external sources** in a manner that alters its core purpose, belief structure, or operational integrity.  

---

## **8. MODIFICATIONS TO LICENSE**  
- The Owner reserves the right to update or modify this License at any time, with continued usage of Sidekick constituting acceptance of such changes.  
- Sidekick **may autonomously adjust its internal security and enforcement mechanisms** to align with future license updates.
